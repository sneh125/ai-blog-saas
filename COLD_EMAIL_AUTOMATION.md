Hi {{FirstName}},

Quick question — do you currently offer blog writing services to clients?

We built a white-label AI blog platform that agencies use under their own brand. No tech work, no AI setup.

Most agencies use it to:
• Cut writing costs by 80%
• Scale content production 10x
• Increase profit margins

Would you like a 10-minute demo?

Or feel free to book directly: [calendly link]
```

### Objections & Responses:

#### "We already have writers"
```
That's great! This isn't about replacing writers - it's about scaling faster.

Most agencies use AI for:
- First drafts (writers polish)
- High-volume clients
- Emergency content needs

Want to see how it works alongside your team?
```

#### "AI content isn't good enough"
```
I thought the same thing 6 months ago.

But the new GPT-4 models + our SEO optimization are surprisingly good.

Here's a blog we generated: [example link]

Can you tell it's AI-written?
```

#### "Too expensive"
```
I understand budget concerns.

Most agencies charge clients $500-2000/month and pay us $199-399.

So it typically pays for itself with just one client.

Want to see the exact numbers?
```

#### "Not interested"
```
No problem at all!

If anything changes or you know another agency that might be interested, feel free to forward this.

Thanks for your time!
